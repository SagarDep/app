#Stackerz

This is an Android app I developed to manage OpenStack Juno 2014.2.4 services, instances and objects. I believe it'll be easy enough to update to be used with newer versions.

Most of the work is done however it is unfinished mostly because I had to cease develpoment due to lack of time and other reasons. Feel free to fork and use the code!
