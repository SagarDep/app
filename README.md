#Stackerz

This is an Android app developed to manage OpenStack Juno 2014.2.4 services, instances and objects. 

Most of the work is done and I believe it'll be easy enough to update to be used with newer versions. However it is unfinished mostly because I had to cease develpoment due to lack of time and other reasons. 

Feel free to fork and use the code!
